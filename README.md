# Goals
The goal of this project is to prepare the TRIM.dat needed by SRIM/TRIM to compute the irradiation damages induced by random fission products generated in the fuel matrix.
# Practical Guide 
1. Download the excel and python files to local files.
2. Revise the excel file location and the TRIM.dat storation locations according to your local positions.
3. Open SRIM/TRIM and select the calculation type as "Ions starting with varying Energies, Angles and Depths". For more info, please refer to "SRIM Special - Using TRIM DAT for TRIM Control" (http://srim.org/SRIM/Tutorials/Tutorials.htm)
4. set the target parameters like density, composition, displacement threshold energy.
